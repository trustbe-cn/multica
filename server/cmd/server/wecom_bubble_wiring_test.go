// What closes the WeCom streaming bubble is a bus subscription holding four
// dependencies, and every one of those five things is invisible when it is
// missing: the events keep being published, nothing panics, nothing logs, and
// the user watches a spinner until the server's window runs out on it. Nothing
// in the wecom package fails either, because every unit test builds its own
// manager and hands it its own dependencies.
//
// So this asserts the whole of it off the REAL boot path — NewRouter, the same
// call main() makes. Two routers are built on two buses, one with the WeCom
// key set and one without, and the difference between them is what the WeCom
// block did. Comparing the two is what lets the subscription half stay honest
// without having to know which other subsystems listen to the same events.
//
// Subscriptions alone are not enough, and that is the point of the second
// half. Register subscribes unconditionally: drop Tasks or Deliveries from the
// boot block and both subscriptions still appear, the counts still rise, and
// every bubble the manager is supposed to close silently stays open. So the
// dependencies are read back off the manager the boot path actually
// registered, not off one this test built.
//
// A nil pool is deliberate: nothing in the WeCom boot block queries the
// database, and metrics_test.go boots the same way.
