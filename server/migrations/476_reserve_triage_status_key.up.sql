-- Reserve the `triage` status key, step 2 of 2: repair the conflicts and
-- validate the barrier (MUL-7212, design MUL-7189 §2.1).
--
-- Migration 475 already refuses any new `triage` row, so the set of workspaces
-- that own a custom `triage` is fixed by the time this file scans for it. Once
-- the new server reads that key as "in Triage", every issue on such a custom
-- status would silently change meaning, so this migration runs before any
-- server that reserves the key starts (the entrypoint finishes migrations
-- first). The file executes as one implicit transaction, and for every
-- workspace that owns a custom `triage` it:
--
--   1. picks a replacement key with the same rule as issuestatus.firstFreeKey:
--      `triage_2`, `triage_3`, ... — the first one this workspace does not own,
--      counting archived rows, because the (workspace_id, key) index is not
--      partial. A fixed name such as `triage_legacy` could collide;
--   2. renames the catalog row, moves the workspace's issues on `triage` to
--      the replacement, and rewrites `triage` inside saved views'
--      query.statusFilters — the only other place a status key is stored as
--      live configuration. activity_log / inbox_item details are history and
--      are left as written;
--   3. reports the counts for the workspace in the migration log.
--
-- Each workspace's catalog is taken under the same EXCLUSIVE advisory lock
-- that archive holds. Old pods still running during the rollout take the
-- SHARED side and re-resolve a custom status before writing an issue onto it,
-- so an in-flight write either commits before the rename (and is moved with
-- the rest) or re-resolves after it and is refused. No issue can be left on
-- the old key.
--
-- VALIDATE then proves no `triage` row is left. It takes SHARE UPDATE
-- EXCLUSIVE, so it does not block reads or writes of the catalog.
--
-- issue.revision is bumped on the moved issues, so a client editing with the
-- old status in hand gets a revision conflict instead of writing it back.
-- The rename is not reversed by the down migration; the replacement key is an
-- ordinary custom key the admin can keep or rename.
